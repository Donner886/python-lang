### Interface in Python
After having went through the chapter of Interface, We can roughly summarize the content as follows: this chapter introduce 
libraries related to implement interface in python: 
1. Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)
2. Typing annotation
3. Inversion of Control in Application / Function

We will deep dive into those three definition above to dig out what can be used in practise, then we want to continue clear 
concept that "How Interface can implement different Design Pattern"

在Python中， 接口的概念并像其他一些编程语言那样的直接和严格。 然而， Python提供了多种方式来实现类似的接口的功能， 确保类遵循特定的结构或提供某些方法。
